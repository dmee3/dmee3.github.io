        <p>Hello!  My name is Dan Meehan, and I am a senior Computer Science Engineering student at The Ohio State University.</p>

        <br />
        <p>This website is currently under construction.</p>

        <h3>Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science Engineering</h3>
        <br />
        <p class="indent">Expected Graduation Date: May 2015</p>
        <p class="indent">3.624 GPA</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Relevant Coursework</h3>
        <br />
        <p class="indent">Software Components, Software Development &amp; Design, Discrete Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Web Applications, Computer Networking, Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Mobile Application Development</p>
        <br />
        <h3>School Experience</h3>
        <br />
        <p class="indent">During my time at Ohio State, I've worked on a variety of challenging projects while also developing my skills as a programmer through a diverse selection of coursework.  As I progressed through the curriculum to earn a degree in computer science engineering, I found myself drawn towards web applications and frameworks, as well as the design and implementation of programming languages.  I've since been able to further explore both of these fields of study through projects and courses available to me as an upperclassman.</p>
        <br />
        <p>After graduation, I plan on continuing my studies at Ohio State in pursuit of a master's degree in computer science.  During this time I will expand my knowledge of programming language structure and function through theoretical and practical studies.</p>

        <h3>Managed Services Reporting Intern | June 2013 - present</h3>
        <br />
        <p class="indent">As a reporting intern, I am in charge of managing and creating SQL reports for company and client use.  These reports pull data from a variety of sources, then organize and display relevant information via lists, tables, and charts.  I also run several digital signage stations which report on metrics for the managed services division and offer managers and employees alike a quick snapshot on service ticket statistics.</p>

        <p>Stacker is a cross-platform mobile application for scheduling group meetings.  It was developed using Adobe PhoneGap to provide support for multiple mobile devices and jQuery Mobile to facilitate a fast and responsive mobile design.  The backend was built on a traditional LAMP stack with server space provided by the Ohio State Computer Science Engineering department during development.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Though my team has finished our contribution, the application is still in development.  Further details will follow once Stacker has been published.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Stacker was created by a four-person team as part of a Capstone course in Software Applications.  My primary contribution to the development process was writing code to communicate with 3rd party calendar services such as Google Calendar.  As the project drew to a close, I branched out to work on interfacing between mobile devices running our software and the central Stacker server, as well as improving the UI for a more fluid experience.</p>

        <br />
        <p>iMusic is an iOS music player with added Facebook and YouTube integration.  Aside from playing music stored on the device, users can view a list of Facebook friends who use the app, see what their friends have been listening to, and browse/search YouTube to find music videos.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The iMusic application was developed for iOS by a 3-man team for Ohio State's Mobile Application Development course.  I and my teammates distributed the workload at regular intervals based on approximately bi-weekly project status checks throughout the semester.  My most important contribution to the project was the implementation of a custom music player class which kept track of song information, as well as ordered and randomized queues of songs based on user input.  I also designed logos for the application, created the player interface view, and worked on standardizing the UI for easy scalability as more features were added to the app.</p>
