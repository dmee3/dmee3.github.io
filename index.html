        <p>Stacker is a cross-platform mobile application for scheduling group meetings.  Further details on the application will follow once it has been published.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Stacker is being created by a four-person team as part of a Capstone course in Software Applications.  My primary contribution to the development process is communicating with 3rd party calendar services such as Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook.</p>

        <p>iMusic is an iOS music player with added Facebook and YouTube integration.  Aside from playing music stored on the device, users can view what their Facebook friends have recently listened to, and browse/search YouTube to find music.</p>
        <br />
        <p>As part of a 3-man team, I am currently working on finalizing the application's style and functional requirements.  The next step in the development process is implementing non-functional requirements, followed by testing before the expected completion date in early December.</p>
