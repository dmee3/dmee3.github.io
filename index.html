I worked on both front- and back-end components, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C# in the .NET framework.  One of several projects I accomplished was to build a command-line application to automate the back-loading of client metric data into a database.</p>

								<p>Cap City Percussion is a world-class competitive percussion ensemble from Columbus, Ohio, whose members are high school and college students from around the midwest.  While I was still performing with the ensemble I served as an administrative assistant and began handling some of the day-to-day tasks of running the ensemble, as well as designing and maintaining the website.</p>
								<p>After the 2015 competitive season, I transitioned from being a member to part of the staff and took up the role of director.  After one season as director, I received a promotion to executive director - an expansion of my responsibilities with the ensemble.  My duties include tracking finances and maintaining the yearly budget, securing rehearsal space for the season, and coordinating an administrative team to handle the logistical operations of the organization.</p>

					<p>The Cap City website serves as both a public-facing informational website serving static content, and a web app to help run Cap City Percussion.  Members can log in to see season schedules, add conflicts with upcoming rehearsal dates, and pay membership fees.</p>
					<p>The website is hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet set up as a LAMP stack.  Laravel is used as a back-end framework for all server-side code.  Google's Material Design specification served as a guide for the UI, and MaterializeCSS was used as the foundation for the site's style.  Additionally, VueJS was employed on certain pages to serve and format large amounts of data with minimal code repetition.</p>

					<p>Stacker is a cross-platform mobile application for scheduling group meetings. It was developed using Adobe PhoneGap to provide support for multiple mobile devices and jQuery Mobile to facilitate a fast and responsive mobile design. The backend was built on a traditional LAMP stack with server space provided by the Ohio State Computer Science Engineering department during development.</p>

					<p>iMusic is an iOS music player with added Facebook and YouTube integration. Aside from playing music stored on the device, users can view a list of Facebook friends who use the app, see what their friends have been listening to, and browse/search YouTube to find music videos.</p>
					<p>The application was developed for iOS by a 3-man team for Ohio State's Mobile Application Development course. I and my teammates distributed the workload at regular intervals based on an agile development plan. My most important contribution to the project was the implementation of a custom class to keep track of audio playback, song queues, and other information related to the music player itself.</p>
