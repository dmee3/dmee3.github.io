				<h4>Managed Services Reporting Intern | June 2013 - present</h4>
				<br />
				<p>As a reporting intern, I am in charge of managing and creating SQL reports for company and client use.  These reports pull data from a variety of sources, then organize and display relevant information via lists, tables, and charts.  I also run several digital signage stations which report on metrics for the managed services division and offer managers and employees alike a quick snapshot on service ticket statistics.</p>

				<h3>Percussion Instructor</h3>
				<br />
				<h4>Westlake High School | May 2013 - present</h4>
				<br />
				<p>I have worked with the Westlake High School marching band for the past 2 seasons as the head percussion instructor.  I work with students throughout the summer and fall months to improve their skills as percussionists in individual and ensemble settings.  Additionally, I am in charge of writing the majority of the exercises, cadences, and show music they use both on and off the field.</p>

				<h3>Stacker</h3>
				<br />
				<h4>Contribution Completed December 2014</h4>
				<br />
				<p>Stacker is a cross-platform mobile application for scheduling group meetings.  It was developed using Adobe PhoneGap to provide support for multiple mobile devices and jQuery Mobile to facilitate a fast and responsive mobile design.  The backend was built on a traditional LAMP stack with server space provided by the Ohio State Computer Science Engineering department during development.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Though my team has finished our contribution, the application is still in development.  Further details will follow once Stacker has been published.</p>

				<h3>iMusic</h3>
				<br />
				<h4>Completed November 2014</h4>
				<br />
				<p>iMusic is an iOS music player with added Facebook and YouTube integration.  Aside from playing music stored on the device, users can view a list of Facebook friends who use the app, see what their friends have been listening to, and browse/search YouTube to find music videos.</p>
				<br />
				<p>The application was developed for iOS by a 3-man team for Ohio State's Mobile Application Development course.  I and my teammates distributed the workload at regular intervals based roughly on an agile development plan.  My most important contribution to the project was the implementation of a custom class to keep track of audio playback, song queues, and other information related to the music player itself.</p>
